# Map builder

This project is something that will hopefully be small and allow me to
take pre-made tiles for board games (Imperial Assult, Shadow of
Brimstone, D&D board games, etc) and build maps on the computer.

## Basic tasks
* [x] Put an image on canvas
* [x] Drag image around canvas
* [x] Put 2 images on canvas
* [x] Select image
* [x] Delete image from canvas
* [x] List contents of resources directory
* [ ] Load arbitrary images onto the canvas
* [ ] Snap images into one "hunk"
* [ ] Save map
* [ ] Import map file
* [ ] Edit imported map file?
